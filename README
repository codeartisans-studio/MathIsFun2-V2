MathIsFun2 is short form of "Math is fun too"
v 02.00.00
This version is complete re-write of version 1. So a new source control repository.

Made with Sparrow framework.
 
A simple game where the user is asked to finish as many questions as possible. 
Uses accelerometer to change the mode of the questions.
The question changes when the counter becomes 1000.

Thats all to it.
